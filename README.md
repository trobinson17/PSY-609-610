# PSY-609-610
A glamorous amalgm of plot and analyses scripts from the 2024-2025 PSY 609/610 course taught by the one and only Dr. Paul J. Silvia at the University of North Carolina (UNC) Greensboro. 

Here you will find a collection of R code that more or less aligns with the structure of the General Linear Model. Throughout the 2024-2025 academic year, we learned how to identify the kinds of variables we are dealing with, visualize our variables using some seriously fabulous plots, explore the systematic connections among our variables, model the phenomenon we're interested in understanding using linear (and not-so-linear) functions, evaluate the degree to which our model captures real-world observations, and talk about our findings using succint and cogent language.

It is my hope that this respository demonstrates my growth since first dabbling with R in Spring 2024. Cheers to advancing from base R to tidyverse. Altogether, despite there being many more lessons (and error messages) ahead, I am quite proud to present here my work from PSY 609/610 at UNC Greensboro.
